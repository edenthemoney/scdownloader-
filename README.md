## üí∞ Monetization Setup

The app is pre-configured with Google AdSense integration:

## üé® Design - Luxurious SoundCloud-Inspired Theme

The app features a **premium dark theme** with:
- Dark luxury backgrounds (#1a1a1a, #2d2d2d)

- Glassmorphism with dark backgrounds and orange borders
- Animated wave decorations (SoundCloud aesthetic)
- Glowing orange effects on all interactive elements
- Animated gradients between orange and gold

## How It Works

- Uses `yt-dlp` to extract audio from SoundCloud
- Converts audio to high-quality MP3 (320kbps)
- Stores downloads in the `downloads/` directory
- Each download session gets a unique ID
- Real-time progress updates via AJAX polling

## Troubleshooting

**"FFmpeg not found" error:**
- Make sure FFmpeg is installed and in your system PATH

**Download fails:**
- Check that the SoundCloud URL is valid
- Some tracks may be region-restricted or private
- Try updating yt-dlp: `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp`

**Slow downloads:**
- This depends on your internet connection and SoundCloud's servers
- Playlists with many tracks will take longer

## Notes

- Downloaded files are stored in `downloads/<session-id>/`
- The app uses threading to handle downloads without blocking the UI
- All tracks are downloaded with their original metadata when available
