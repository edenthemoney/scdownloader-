```bash
cd /Users/edenroy/CascadeProjects/soundcloud-crash-free

- Render will automatically deploy your changes
- Takes about 2-3 minutes
- Watch the Render dashboard for deployment status

### Step 3: Test
1. Visit: https://soundcloudfreeplaylistdownloader.xyz/ads.txt

2. Visit: https://soundcloudfreeplaylistdownloader.xyz/ad-test

## Most Likely Reasons Ads Aren't Showing

### 1. Ad Blocker (90% of cases)
- **Fix**: Disable ALL browser extensions
- **Test**: Use incognito/private mode
- **Try**: Different browser or device

### 2. Domain Not Approved in AdSense
- **Check**: https://www.google.com/adsense/ ‚Üí Sites
- **Fix**: Add `soundcloudfreeplaylistdownloader.xyz` to Sites
- **Wait**: 24-48 hours for approval

### 3. New Account/Site
- **Issue**: Google needs time to process new sites
- **Wait**: 24-48 hours after domain approval
- **Drive**: Some real traffic to your site

### 4. Missing ads.txt (NOW FIXED)
- **Was**: Not accessible
- **Now**: Created and configured
- **Verify**: https://soundcloudfreeplaylistdownloader.xyz/ads.txt

## Check These Right Now

1. **AdSense Dashboard**: https://www.google.com/adsense/
   - Is your account approved?
   - Is your domain in "Sites"?
   - Any policy warnings?

2. **Browser Console** (F12):
   - Any red errors?
   - AdSense script loaded?
   - Ad slots filled?

3. **Ad Blocker**:
   - Completely disable it
   - Test in incognito mode
   - Try mobile device

## Expected Timeline
